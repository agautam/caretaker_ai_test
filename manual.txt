================================================================================
5. MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
================================================================================

Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance and system longevity.

Monthly:
- Inspect and clean air filters
- Check condensate drain lines
- Verify thermostat operation

Quarterly:
- Inspect evaporator and condenser coils
- Check refrigerant levels
- Test safety controls
- Inspect electrical connections

Annually:
- Complete system performance evaluation
- Refrigerant leak detection test
- Compressor oil analysis (if applicable)
- Calibration of all sensors and controls
- Professional deep cleaning of all components

================================================================================
6. ERROR CODES
================================================================================

The Caretaker X100 features an integrated diagnostic system that monitors
system performance and reports operational issues through a series of error
codes. When an error condition is detected, the system will display the
appropriate error code on the control panel and may enter a protective
shutdown mode.

All error codes should be addressed promptly by qualified service personnel.
Refer to the troubleshooting guide (Section 7) for detailed diagnostic
procedures.

ERROR 001: FILTER CLOG
-----------------------
Severity: Warning
System Response: Reduced airflow mode, efficiency degradation

Description:
The system has detected excessive restriction in the air filtration system,
indicating that the air filter requires replacement or cleaning. A clogged
filter reduces system efficiency, increases energy consumption, and may lead
to coil freezing or compressor damage if left unaddressed.

Diagnostic Indicators:
- Reduced airflow at supply registers
- Increased static pressure across filter
- Elevated system operating temperatures
- Reduced cooling/heating capacity

Recommended Actions:
1. Power down system at service disconnect
2. Locate and inspect air filter(s)
3. Replace disposable filters or clean reusable filters according to
   manufacturer specifications
4. Verify filter installation is correct (check airflow direction arrows)
5. Clear error code from diagnostic system
6. Restart system and verify normal operation
7. Document service in maintenance log

Prevention:
- Replace or clean filters according to maintenance schedule
- Use appropriate filter MERV rating for application
- Monitor filter condition monthly

ERROR 002: LOW REFRIGERANT
---------------------------
Severity: Critical
System Response: Compressor protection shutdown, system lockout

Description:
The diagnostic system has detected refrigerant charge levels below acceptable
operating parameters. Low refrigerant charge can cause compressor damage,
reduced system capacity, and inefficient operation. This condition requires
immediate attention by a certified HVAC technician.

Diagnostic Indicators:
- Subcooling and superheat values outside normal range
- Reduced system capacity
- Compressor overheating
- Potential ice formation on evaporator coil
- Elevated compressor current draw

Recommended Actions:
1. IMMEDIATELY shut down system at service disconnect
2. DO NOT attempt to operate system until issue is resolved
3. Perform comprehensive leak detection test on entire refrigerant circuit
4. Identify and repair all refrigerant leaks
5. Evacuate system to proper vacuum levels
6. Recharge system with correct refrigerant type and quantity per unit
   specifications
7. Verify proper subcooling and superheat values
8. Test system operation under load conditions
9. Clear error code and document service

WARNING: Refrigerant handling requires EPA Section 608 certification.
Unauthorized refrigerant handling is illegal and dangerous.

Prevention:
- Annual professional leak detection inspections
- Proper installation of refrigerant line sets
- Protection of refrigerant lines from physical damage
- Regular monitoring of system performance metrics

ERROR 003: SHORT CYCLING
-------------------------
Severity: Warning
System Response: Normal operation with efficiency reduction

Description:
The system has detected excessive on/off cycling behavior, indicating that
the unit is starting and stopping more frequently than optimal. Short cycling
reduces system efficiency, increases wear on components, and may indicate
improper system sizing or control configuration issues.

Root Causes:
- Thermostat placement in location affected by direct sunlight, drafts, or
  heat sources
- Oversized unit relative to space requirements
- Incorrect hysteresis settings on control system
- Rapid temperature fluctuations in conditioned space
- Faulty temperature sensors

Diagnostic Indicators:
- Compressor cycles more than 6 times per hour under normal load
- Rapid temperature swings in conditioned space
- Increased energy consumption
- Premature component wear

Recommended Actions:
1. Verify thermostat placement is optimal (away from heat sources, drafts,
   and direct sunlight)
2. Evaluate system sizing relative to space requirements
3. Adjust hysteresis settings on control system:
   - Access service menu on control board
   - Navigate to "System Settings" > "Hysteresis Control"
   - Adjust differential to recommended range (typically 2-3°F for cooling,
     1-2°F for heating)
   - Allow system to operate and monitor cycling behavior
4. If issue persists, consider:
   - Relocating thermostat to more appropriate location
   - Installing additional temperature sensors for averaging
   - Consulting with system designer regarding unit sizing
5. Clear error code after resolution
6. Monitor system operation for 24-48 hours to verify correction

Prevention:
- Proper system sizing during initial installation
- Correct thermostat placement during installation
- Regular calibration of temperature sensors
- Monitoring of system cycling behavior during routine maintenance
